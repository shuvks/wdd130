    <h2>Austin</h2>
    <p>Hey, my name is Austin. This is my first year in college where I will be starting towards an Applied Technology degree. Some things I love to do is listen to music, hang out with friends, and travel. I took this class in hopes to one day to make my own personal website, just for fun.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. My favorite quote would have to be the popular "doubt your doubts before you doubt God" by President Uchtdorf. My favorite scripture being Alma chapter 7, verse 11. It talks about how Jesus Christ took upon Himself all of our sicknesses and afflictions in order for us to make it back to Him.</p>
    <p>In the future I hope to get a good paying remote job which will allow me to travel while working. I served a mission in the Philippines and LOVED IT! Ever since, I've been wanting to explore more cultures, try new food, and take pictures of beautiful views. I REALLY want to go visit England one of these days.</p>
