    <p class="video_text">The purpose of my website is to help individuals and families better connect with their extended families. It will contain information such as an individuals social media, occupation, state, phone number, etc. This is intended to show individuals how closely related they are to extended family individuals and/or help them get to know each other.</p>

    <p class="AboutUs_firsttext">On the profile page, you will have the opportunity to custom-create your profile. In this profile, you will have the option to add a picture along with a slideshow or folder of other pictures you might want to add for other extended family members to see. The only thing that will be mandatorily seen will be your full name, profile picture (along with pictures you might want others to see), and interests (bio). Other options you can add to be seen by others include your age, address, phone number, health history, occupation, etc. Basically, just more personal things that you might not want a complete stranger to know unless you felt more comfortable about it. Note: only your own verified extended family members (and your immediate family members) can see your profile.</p>
    <p class="AboutUs_secondtext">You will also have the opportunity to discover other extended family members and see either the exact distance you are with them on the family tree or an estimated guess, depending on the data received. The discover page will be displayed as a family tree where you will have access to drag around the screen and click on certain pictures and names of profiles you are interested in. When accessing an extended family member’s profile through the discover page, you will be directed to their profile where you will have the option to send them a request to chat with them privately. If they accept the request, you will then have the option to comment on their profile picture and message them directly. I will also add a feature that if you block a certain family member, their face on the family tree with be “burned out”, leaving an image of a burnt picture. However, it should be noted that you will only be able to see the names and pictures of verified individuals in your extended family tree.</p>
